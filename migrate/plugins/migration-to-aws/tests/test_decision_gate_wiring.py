"""Guard: both handoff exits must wire the web-handoff.

The fixture asserters and test_emit_plan_json.py both cover the WRITER itself
(that a run's artifacts yield a valid plan.json). Nothing else guards that the
skill handlers actually invoke the writer and present the import CTA at the two
exits that reach a customer: the Estimate decision gate ("Done for now") and the
Generate completion. Without this, silently deleting those steps from the skill
markdown would leave the whole suite green. These checks anchor on stable
substrings (the script filename, the import-page path, and the writer's
PLAN_OK/PLAN_SKIP status tokens) so benign rewording does not trip them.
